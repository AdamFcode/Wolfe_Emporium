         <span class="black-text">Gene Wolfe(1931-2019) was one of America's most prolific fantasy and sci-fi writers, publishing thirty-two novels and numerous short-story collections. 
            With dense, cryptic prose that often requires repeat reads to fully decode, it should be expected that he be lauded in literary centres across the world. However, despite critical acclaim and being known as "<i>your favourite fantasy author's favourite author</i>", his less commercially successful works are yet to receive reprints.</span>

            <span class="black-text">Along with countless awards for individual works, Wolfe won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1996 and was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2007. He was voted the 29th SFWA Grand Master in December 2012; in 2013, the annual Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award was presented to Wolfe during Nebula Awards weekend. Wolfe also received the 1989 Edward E. Smith Memorial Award (or "Skylark") at the New England convention Boskone. In 2012 he was presented with the first Chicago Literary Hall of Fame Fuller Award, for outstanding contribution to literature by a Chicago author. After his death, Wolfe was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame. Wolfe was the first Fuller Award recipient to be inducted in 2019, with the ceremony being delayed until 2021 due to covid. Most importantly, he is credited with designing the machines that produced the iconic pringles can. For this pivitol contribution, the logo depicted on the can was fashioned after his likeness.</span>
